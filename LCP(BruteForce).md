## Question 14: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

### What is a Prefix?
- **Prefix**: A sequence of characters at the beginning of a string.
- A prefix can be a single letter or a group of letters.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are all the strings lowercase, or should the function be case-insensitive?
2. Are the strings limited to ASCII characters, or should the function support Unicode characters as well (e.g., emojis, accented characters)?
3. What is the maximum number of strings that can be included in the array?

### Callout Assumptions:
- If the array is empty, the function should return an empty string.
- There are no leading or trailing spaces that need to be handled.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity (TC)**: `L * (N - 1) = O(N * L)`, where `L` is the length of the shortest string and `N` is the number of strings.
- **Space Complexity (SC)**: `O(L)` for storing the result.

### Implementation:
```java
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        if(strs == null || strs.length == 0) {
            return "";
        }
        if(strs.length == 1){
            return strs[0];
        }
        String prefix = strs[0];
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = 0; i < prefix.length(); i++){
            char c = prefix.charAt(i);
            for(int j = 1; j < strs.length; j++){
                if(i == strs[j].length() || strs[j].charAt(i) != c){
                    return result.toString();
                }
            }
            result.append(c);
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Key Condition:
In the provided code snippet, the condition `if(i == strs[j].length() || strs[j].charAt(i) != c)` is a crucial part of the logic that determines whether the current character being examined is part of the longest common prefix among the given strings in the `strs` array.

#### Breakdown of the Condition:
1. **`i == strs[j].length()`**:
   - This checks whether the current index `i` has reached the end of the string `strs[j]`.
   - Strings in Java are 0-indexed, meaning that the index starts at 0. The length of the string is the number of characters in it, but since the index starts at 0, the valid indices are from `0` to `length - 1`.
   - If `i` equals `strs[j].length()`, it means that we have reached the end of the string `strs[j]`, and there are no more characters left in this string to compare with the other strings.
   - In this case, the current prefix cannot be extended further because one of the strings in the array has ended.

2. **`strs[j].charAt(i) != c`**:
   - This checks whether the character at the current index `i` in the string `strs[j]` is different from the character `c`, which is the character at index `i` in the first string `strs[0]`.
   - If the characters are not the same, it means that the common prefix among all strings has ended at the previous index, and we should stop adding characters to the prefix.

### Explanation of the Logic:
- The loop iterates over each character `c` in the first string `prefix` (which is `strs[0]`).
- For each character in `prefix`, the inner loop checks if this character is present at the same position in all other strings (`strs[j]`).
- The condition `if(i == strs[j].length() || strs[j].charAt(i) != c)` has two possible scenarios:
  1. If one of the strings is shorter than the current length of the prefix (`i == strs[j].length()`), it indicates that this string can't possibly have a longer common prefix, so the method should return the prefix found so far.
  2. If the character at index `i` in any string doesn't match the corresponding character `c` from `prefix`, the method should return the prefix found so far, as the common prefix has ended.

### Example:
Consider the input `strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]`:
- The initial `prefix` is "flower".
- The outer loop starts checking each character of "flower".
- At index `i = 2` ("f", "l", "o"), everything matches.
- At index `i = 3`, "flower" has 'w', "flow" has 'w', but "flight" has 'i'. So the condition `strs[j].charAt(i) != c` becomes true, and the method returns "flo", which is the longest common prefix.

The line `if(i == strs[j].length() || strs[j].charAt(i) != c)` ensures that the loop only continues while the characters match and there are characters available to compare in each string. Once a mismatch or the end of a string is found, it stops and returns the current result as the longest common prefix.

### Limitations and Optimizations:

#### A] Limitations:
1. **Dependence on the First String**:
   - The current approach assumes the first string in the array is the potential longest common prefix. If the first string is significantly longer or different from the others, it might lead to unnecessary comparisons.

2. **Character-by-Character Comparison**:
   - The approach performs a character-by-character comparison for each string, which might be inefficient if the common prefix is very short compared to the length of the strings.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The current implementation does not handle cases where the array is empty or where the first string is empty, which can lead to potential runtime errors.

#### B] Optimizations:
1. **Early Termination**:
   - We can optimize the solution by checking for the minimum length string first and limiting our comparison to that length. This ensures we do not compare unnecessary characters beyond the shortest string length.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - Improve handling of edge cases such as empty arrays or empty strings within the array.

3. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - Use a binary search approach to find the longest common prefix. This can reduce the number of comparisons by checking the middle point and adjusting the search range based on the result.

4. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - Use a divide and conquer approach to split the array into two halves, find the longest common prefix for each half, and then combine the results. This can help to optimize comparisons.
